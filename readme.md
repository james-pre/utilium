# Utilium

A bunch of utilities for Typescript. This includes:

-   Structs (using decorators)
-   Compile-time math types
-   Debugging types
-   Convenience types and functions for strings and objects
-   RNG functions
-   `List`, a class that combines the best aspects of `Set` and arrays
-   `JSONFileMap` and `FolderMap`
-   Version utilities
-   Xterm.js shell handling (arrows, home/end, prompting, etc.)
